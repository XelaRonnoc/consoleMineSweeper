# ConsoleMineSweeper
My take on a console version of the classic compute game minesweeeper equiped with all the feautres (minus flagging potential mines) you would expect from mine sweeper including saving high scores, ability to select number of mines and map size (limited to 10x10 for readabilities sake).

TO DO: 
- bring logic changes over to the graphicalMineSweeper version
- See graphicalMineSweeper all further improvements will be made to this repository in order to make a more accurate re-creation
